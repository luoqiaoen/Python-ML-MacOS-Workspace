# machine learning exercise
Some simple exercise codes written by me when following online courses and some snippets of coursework codes I wrote in the optimization and the image processing courses (just snippets as the lecturers may still be using the same exercises).

PPT made for group discussion: intro_to_deep_learning.pdf
