# Machine Learning Exercises
Some written example codes when following online courses (offered by Lazyprogrammer, some utility files from https://lazyprogrammer.me/) and snippets of coursework codes I wrote in the optimization and model-based image processing courses (just snippets as the lecturers may still be using the same exercises).

* linear regression in numpy
* logistic regression in numpy
* deep learning 1: feedforward and backpropagation in numpy
* deep learning 2: complete neural network implementation in Theano, TensorFlow
* CNN in Theano and TensorFlow
* expression recognition project using regression and CNN
* image classification TensorFlow sample project
* computer vision in keras: vgg, class activation map, keras cnn, object detection
* neural style transfer project
* Bayes classifier using scipy and scikit-learn
* single hidden layer autoencoder and deep convolutional Generative Adversarial Networks (dcGANs) in TensorFlow
* PPT made for short group discussion: intro_to_deep_learning.pdf
* Purdue coursework code snippets

I used the textbook: Deep Learning (Ian Goodfellow, Yoshua Bengio, and Aaron Courville) for more detailed theory.
