# machine learning excersice
Some simple excercise codes written by me when following online courses and some snippets of coursework codes I wrote in the optimization and the image processing courses (just snippets as the lecturers may still be using the same exercises).

Courses offered by Lazyprogrammer on following topics:
- Linear Regression in Python
- Logistic Regression in Python
- Deep Learning in Python
- Practical Deep Learning in Theano and TensorFlow

Some utility files from https://lazyprogrammer.me/

Theory used can be found in Deep Learning (Ian Goodfellow, Yoshua Bengio, and Aaron Courville)
