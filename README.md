# Machine Learning Exercises
Some written example codes when following online courses (offered by Lazyprogrammer, some utility files from https://lazyprogrammer.me/) and snippets of coursework codes I wrote in the optimization and model-based image processing courses (just snippets as the lecturers may still be using the same exercises).

Python:
1. linear regression in numpy
2. logistic regression in numpy
3. deep learning 1: feedforward and backpropagation in numpy
4. deep learning 2: complete neural network implementation in Theano, TensorFlow
5. CNN in Theano and TensorFlow
6. expression recognition project using regression and CNN
7. image classification TensorFlow sample project
8. computer vision in keras: vgg, class activation map, keras cnn, object detection
9. neural style transfer project
10. Bayes classifier using scipy and scikit-learn
11. single hidden layer autoencoder in TensorFlow
12. deep convolutional Generative Adversarial Networks (dcGANs) in TensorFlow

Extra stuff:
13. PPT made for short group discussion: intro_to_deep_learning.pdf
14. Purdue coursework code snippets

I used the textbook: Deep Learning (Ian Goodfellow, Yoshua Bengio, and Aaron Courville) for more detailed theory.
